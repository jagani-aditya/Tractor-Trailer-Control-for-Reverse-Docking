# PathPlanning_TruckTrailorSystem
Project for the lecture Automotive Control Systems building an autonomous truck trailor system including Path Planning, Trajectory Generation and Control

For this system create a stabilizing feedback control using the flatness approach.Matlabfunctions to calculate the Lie derivatives and fourth order derivative of the reference coordinate subject to the arc length are provided. Also a function, that calculates the derivatives of the path polynomial given the initial or final truck/trailer configuration. It is recommended to use a 7thorder polynomial for the path.It is also recommended to first use the open loop variant for testing.The results have to be properly documented in a selfcontainingand scientifically well written report. The grading is based on validation of robustness, quality of code, visualisationand documentation.
